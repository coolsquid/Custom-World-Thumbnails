# Custom World Thumbnails
Custom World Thumbnails allows you to use screenshots as world thumbnails (the tiny images besides each world in the world GUI) by holding P when taking them.

It also allows pack makers to ship a default world thumbnail. This can be done by placing a 64x64 picture called thumbnail.png in the configuration directory.
